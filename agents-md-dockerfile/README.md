# AGENTS.md for Dockerfile Conversions

This is an example [`AGENTS.md`](https://agents.md/) (and `CLAUDE.md`) that
instruct AI agents on how to convert Dockerfiles to use Chainguard images.

This is intended to inform a prompt like:

```
Can you please convert examples/node/Dockerfile to use Chainguard images?
```

## Examples

There are some examples under `examples/` which you can use to test the
effectiveness of the agent and refine the instructions.
